# dns4java
Simplified pluggable DNS for Java
Sometimes you need certain queries sent through one set of DNS servers while other queries sent to the root servers or public DNS servers.
This project is to enable a bit more control over the DNS and builds on the functionality provided by [dnsjava](http://dnsjava.org/)

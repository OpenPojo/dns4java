### Simplified control over DNS routing in JAVA
When you need more control on which DNS servers to use in Java for certain hosts or domains.

#### Quick startup
Create a DNS Control configuration file as such:
```properties
# Selection order is more specific wins
# For example, if you have a host override, domain override, and default override, they will be processed in that order.
# The left hand side is the over ride destination, the right hand is the list of dns servers to use.
# Left hand entries should be unique, one entry per destination override.
# Setup default DNS servers, this is optional, if its not set, the system will fall back on the current OS's DNS servers.
.=10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2
# Override DNS lookups for specific hosts
www.openpojo.com=10.1.1.1
# Override DNS lookups for specific whole domains
.openpojo.com=10.0.2.2
# Suppress any queries that you'd like to never resolve
hiddenhost.openpojo.com=
```
startup your JVM passing NameService provider as well as DNS routing file
```sh
java -Dsun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.1=dns,dnscontrol -Ddnscontrol.conf.file=/path/where/dns_control_file
```

Builds on the functionality provided by [dnsjava](http://dnsjava.org/).
